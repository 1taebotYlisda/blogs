# How to Play Serious Sam 3 Without the Invincible Scorpion
 
If you are a fan of Serious Sam 3: BFE, you might have encountered a problem while playing the game: an invincible scorpion that chases you relentlessly and kills you in one hit. This scorpion is not part of the game's design, but a clever anti-piracy measure by the developers, Croteam. The scorpion only appears on pirated versions of the game, as a way to discourage illegal downloads and encourage players to buy the game.
